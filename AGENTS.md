# Agent Instructions

## Critical workflow

- Windows-first project: prefer PowerShell 7.6, Windows-native paths, and installed project tools unless there is a clear reason not to!
- After code changes, run `python build.py --skip-updates`; do not use `python build.py --version`!
- Always git commit after code changes!
- Before committing, run relevant tests/unit tests and ensure build/test results succeed.
- Commit completed code changes with plain git commands only: `git status`, `git add -A`, `git commit -m "<message>"`!
- Do not push to cloud unless explicitly requested, generally just commit locally!
- Always consult `llm-wiki/` for code, bug, build, test, config, debugging, or behavior work!
- Keep `llm-wiki/` linted / quality-checked and updated when durable project knowledge changes!
- Always update `llm-wiki/` after code changes!
- Mistrust code, code annotations and llm-wiki! Each of them might be stale our outdated! Come to your on conclusion and act based on that!
- When fixing a bug or implementing a feature, generally always add new regression test units, or adjust existing ones!
- When fixing a bug or implementing a feature, generally always increase or improve debug logging to make bug diagnosis easier!

## Engineering rules

- Prefer root-cause fixes over workarounds; do not hide, ignore, weaken, or paper over failures!
- Perform thorough thinking about actual root causes of crashes and other issues for proper fixes!
- If the result after thorough thinking is that proper fixes require bigger changes, they generally should be implemented!
- Do not just mitigate fallout, take the hard route of proper and solid root cause fixes!
- Do not use sleeps, wait tables, polling delays, or timing bandaids as crash/race fixes!
- Do not introduce nor accept racy, timing-sensitive, or fragile behavior!
- Keep source files roughly 600-800 lines maximum; split up files when needed!
- Treat dumps, logs, media, captures, credentials, private keys, tokens, symbols, and user data as sensitive!
- Do not commit secrets, dumps, logs, captures, private-symbol PDBs, large generated artifacts, user names or private user data!

## Non-negotiable project constraints

- Do not disable features to avoid fixing bugs!
- Do not add game-specific compatibility hacks, we only accept generic solutions for all components!
- Do not use D3D11On12 for the DX12 overlay; use native DX12!
- Do not disable the overlay with FSR FG or DLSS FG to prevent crashes; find proper fixes!
- Switching between FG modes must work gracefully both in Talos and GTA validation scenarios: in all directions/combinations, no crashes, no lost overlay rendering, and correct visible FG status!
- The overlay must not be suspended unnecessarily long, also not during FG switching transitions!
- Ideally, the overlay never gets visibly suspended / does never disappear, not even temporarily!

## Build, diagnostics, and tests

- Fix pre-existing, as well as introduced LSP errors/warnings along they way!
- We are paranoid about having sufficient regression tests, better too many than too few!
- Add focused regression tests where possible, especially tests that would have failed before the fix!
- If no regression-test infrastructure exists for the area, consider adding suitable unit infrastructure such as GoogleTest!
- Do not add sleeps or timing assumptions to tests!
- Check whether touched/new code has sufficient unit coverage, and add new test units accordingly!

## Debugging and logging

- We are paranoid about having sufficient debug logging!
- Add additional debug logging when it helps diagnose issue root causes, state transitions, failure modes, unexpected runtime conditions, or future regressions!
- Ensure builds preserve useful debug symbols etc. so crash dumps contain actionable information!
- For media analysis, `ffmpeg.exe` and `ffprobe.exe` are in `%USERPROFILE%\Programme\build\captureproject\build\msys64\clang64\bin`.

## Windows debugging and binary analysis tools

- When analyzing crash dumps, use the correct symbol path that includes both the Microsoft symbol server AND the local PDB directory:
```
cdb -z crash.dmp -y "srv*;%USERPROFILE%\Programme\build\captureproject\installed\captureengine" -c ".ecxr; k; q"
```
The `srv*`-only path misses CE's local PDBs and produces incomplete stack traces.

- Common installed Windows tools for `.dmp` files, symbol, PE/COFF:

| Tool | Purpose | Installed/default path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cdb.exe` | Command-line `.dmp` debugging and stack inspection | `C:\Program Files\Windows Kits\10\Debuggers\x64\cdb.exe` |
| `windbg.exe` | Interactive `.dmp` debugging | `C:\Program Files\Windows Kits\10\Debuggers\x64\windbg.exe` |
| `ffmpeg.exe` | Media conversion/inspection helper for captures | `%USERPROFILE%\Programme\build\captureproject\build\msys64\clang64\bin\ffmpeg.exe` |
| `ffprobe.exe` | Media metadata/probing helper for captures | `%USERPROFILE%\Programme\build\captureproject\build\msys64\clang64\bin\ffprobe.exe` |

## `llm-wiki/` workflow

- `llm-wiki/` is canonical LLM-maintained derived memory, not the sole source of truth.
- For substantial work, start with `llm-wiki/index.md`, read only relevant topic pages, then read `llm-wiki/log/recent.md` for active/stale-risk areas.
- Read archives only when historical context is needed or explicitly linked.
- For trivial localized edits, skip broad wiki loading unless the area is unfamiliar or stale-risk is likely.
- If `llm-wiki/` is missing during substantial work, create `index.md`, `overview.md`, and `log/recent.md` by inspecting repo structure, build/test entry points, config, docs, and workflows.
- Mistrust wiki claims until verified against code (but mistrust code too!), tests, build scripts, config, or observed behavior.
- Prefer updating existing pages over creating new ones; create new pages only for reusable topics.
- Keep topic pages focused on current best understanding; put chronology, partial investigations, and temporary notes in `llm-wiki/log/recent.md`.
- Mark uncertainty explicitly as open question, stale-risk, or unverified claim.
- Do not dump raw logs or long command output unless it establishes durable knowledge.
- Update the wiki when durable knowledge changes: architecture, behavior, build/test/package/deploy/debug workflows, bugs/root causes, invariants, conventions, rejected approaches, follow-ups, or code style.
- Do not update the wiki for trivial edits with no future-useful context.
- `llm-wiki/debug-tools.md` contains additional available debug commands and tool paths.
- `llm-wiki/index.md` is a compact routing table with page link, purpose, last verified date, and stale-risk.
- Durable topic pages should include summary, source anchors, invariants, diagnostics/failure modes, open questions/stale-risk, and last verified details.
- `llm-wiki/log/recent.md` is newest-first rolling memory; archive older entries when it gets too long.
- After both wiki updates and code changes, perform a semantic quality check for contradictions, stale claims, duplicates, orphan pages, broken links, missing source anchors, and merge/delete/archive candidates.
